# Power BI Project: Sales Data Analysis

This Power BI project aims to analyze sales data by integrating various data sources, performing data transformation, and leveraging Power BI's robust capabilities for data modeling and visualization. The end goal is to create an interactive and insightful report that showcases key metrics and trends in the company's sales performance.

## 1. Set up the Environment
- Download Power BI desktop on Windows Machine
- Set Up a GitHub Repo for the project

## 2. Import the Data into Power BI

### 2.1. Import and prepare the orders_powerbi table from an Azure SQL Database, ensuring data integrity and privacy.

**Connect to Azure SQL Database:**

**Server Name:** 'Server-Name'

**Database Name:** powerbi-orders-db

**Username:** 'User-Name'

**Password:** 'Password'

**Data Preparation:**
- Remove Sensitive Data:
Deleted the [Card Number] column to ensure data privacy.
- Date and Time Separation:
Split the [Order Date] and [Shipping Date] columns into two distinct columns each.
- Data Integrity:
Filtered out and removed any rows where the [Order Date] column had missing or null values.
- Column Renaming:
Renamed columns to follow Power BI naming conventions, enhancing clarity and consistency in the report.

### 2.2. Use Power BI's Get Data option to import the Products.csv file into the project.

**Data Preparation:**
- Remove Duplicates:
Applied the Remove Duplicates function on the product_code column to ensure uniqueness.
- Column Renaming:
Renamed columns to align with Power BI naming conventions, ensuring consistency in presentation.

### 2.3. Import the Stores table from Azure Blob Storage and prepare it for analysis.

**Connect to Azure Blob Storage:**

- **Account Name:** 'AccountName'

- **Account Key:** 'AccountKey'

- **Container Name:** data-analytics

Used Power BI's Get Data option to connect to Azure Blob Storage and import the Stores table.

**Data Preparation:**
- Column Renaming:
Renamed columns to follow Power BI naming conventions for clarity and consistency.

###Â 2.4. Import and combine multiple CSV files from a folder into a single Customers table, ensuring consistency and data integrity.

Downloaded the Customers.zip file, unzipped it. Used the Folder data connector in Power BI to import the Customers folder. 

Combined and transformed the data from the three CSV files into one query, ensuring the data was correctly appended.

**Data Preparation:**

- Create Full Name Column:
Created a Full Name column by concatenating the [First Name] and [Last Name] columns using the following DAX formula:

```
Full Name = [First Name] & " " & [Last Name]
```

- Remove Unused Columns:
Deleted any obviously unused columns (e.g., index columns) to streamline the dataset.

- Column Renaming:
Renamed remaining columns to align with Power BI naming conventions for consistency.

## 3. Create the Data Model
To make use of Power BI's time intelligence functions, a continuous Date table was created, covering the entire period of the sales data.

- Identify the Date Range & Create the Date Table:

Generated a continuous Date table using the following DAX formula:
```
Date = 
CALENDAR(
    DATE(YEAR(MIN(Orders[Order Date])), 1, 1), 
    DATE(YEAR(MAX(Orders[Shipping Date])), 12, 31)
)
```

To enhance the functionality of the Date table, I added several calculated columns:
DAX
```
'Date'[Day of Week] = WEEKDAY('Date'[Date])
'Date'[Month Number] = MONTH('Date'[Date])
'Date'[Month Name] = FORMAT('Date'[Date], "MMMM")
'Date'[Quarter] = QUARTER('Date'[Date])
'Date'[Year] = YEAR('Date'[Date])
'Date'[Start of Year] = DATE('Date'[Year], 1, 1)
'Date'[Start of Quarter] = STARTOFQUARTER('Date'[Date])
'Date'[Start of Month] = STARTOFMONTH('Date'[Date])
'Date'[Start of Week] = 'Date'[Date] - WEEKDAY('Date'[Date], 1) + 1
```

The Date table now includes essential time-related columns, enabling robust time intelligence analysis in the subsequent tasks.

- Establishing Relationships and Building a Star Schema

I created the following relationships to form a star schema:

| From Table | From Column  | To Table | To Column     | Relationship Type |
|------------|--------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Products   | product_code | Orders   | product_code  | One-to-Many       |
| Stores     | store code   | Orders   | Store Code    | One-to-Many       |
| Customers  | User UUID    | Orders   | User ID       | One-to-Many       |
| Date       | Date         | Orders   | Order Date    | One-to-Many       |
| Date       | Date         | Orders   | Shipping Date | One-to-Many       |

- Creating a Separate Measures Table
To maintain an organized and efficient data model, a separate Measures table was created for storing all DAX measures. The Measures Table serves as a centralized location for all measures, improving the organization and manageability of the data model.

A set of key measures was created to provide foundational metrics for the sales analysis.
```
Total Orders = COUNTROWS(Orders)
Total Revenue = SUMX(Orders, Orders[Product Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Sale_Price]))
Total Profit = SUMX(Orders, (RELATED(Products[Sale_Price]) - RELATED(Products[Cost_Price])) * Orders[Product Quantity])
Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[User ID])
Total Quantity = SUM(Orders[Product Quantity])
Profit YTD = TOTALYTD([Total Profit], 'Date'[Date])
Revenue YTD = TOTALYTD([Total Revenue], 'Date'[Date])
```

These measures provide a strong foundation for the sales analysis, enabling insights into orders, revenue, profit, and customer behavior over time.

- Creating Hierarchies
Hierarchies were created to allow for detailed drill-down capabilities in the reports, facilitating granular analysis.

The Date hierarchy was created with the following levels:

- **Start of Year**
- **Start of Quarter**
- **Start of Month**
- **Start of Week**
- **Date**

Geography Hierarchy:
A calculated column Country was added to the Stores table:
```
Country = SWITCH([Country Code], "GB", "United Kingdom", "US", "United States", "DE", "Germany")

Geography = [Country Region] & ", " & [Country]
```
The Geography hierarchy was created with the following levels:

- **World Region**

- **Country**

- **Country Region**


The correct data categories were assigned to the following columns:

- **World Region**: `Continent`

- **Country**: `Country`

- **Country Region**: `State or Province`

The hierarchies enable users to drill down into data by time and geography, enhancing the interactivity and depth of the analysis.

## 4. Set up the Report

Create the foundational structure of the Power BI report by setting up four main report pages and applying a consistent color theme across the entire report.

   - **Create Report Pages**:

     - **Executive Summary**: This page will provide a high-level overview of key business metrics and trends.#

     - **Customer Detail**: This page will focus on detailed customer data, including customer segmentation and behavior analysis.

     - **Product Detail**: This page will provide in-depth insights into product performance, including sales, profitability, and category trends.

     - **Stores Map**: This page will visually represent store performance across different geographic regions using map visuals.

   - **Select and Apply a Color Theme**:

     - Explored the available pre-defined themes in Power BI to find one that aligns with the branding and visual identity of the report.

   - **Add Navigation Sidebar**:

     - Added a rectangle shape on the Executive Summary page, covering a narrow strip on the left side of the page.

     - Set the fill color of the rectangle to a contrasting color that complements the chosen theme.

     - This sidebar will be used as a navigation panel to switch between different pages in the report.

   - **Duplicate Sidebar Across Pages**:

     - Duplicated the rectangle shape on each of the other report pages (Customer Detail, Product Detail, and Stores Map).

     - Ensured the sidebar maintains the same size, position, and color across all pages for a uniform look and feel.

## 5. Build the Customer Detail Page
